Sphumelele Mngoma The Durban University of Technology (DUT) is offering a rebate in tuition fees as part of an incentive to new and existing students who have excelled in their studies. Top achievers stand to benefit from the more than R3,5 million set aside for the remission of fees. DUT said students who obtained 80% and more in their matric results will receive a full remission on tuition fees, while those with marks between 70 and 80% will get a 75% discount. For existing DUT students, 50% of tuition fees will be waived for students who attained 75% or more at the end of last year, while students who passed all registered subjects with distinctions receive a 100% rebate, they said. DUT spokeswoman Nomonde Mbadi said there are a lot of financial opportunities and incentives to accommodate everyone academically deserving. According to Mbadi, the financially in-need are provided for through the government loan called the National Students Financial Aid (NSFAS). However, the liaison officer for the student representative council (SRC), Mthunzi Gumede, said students face financial exclusion. He said they have been ignored, despite requests to meet with management to address these and other issues before the studentsâ€™ return to campus. The SRC demands DUT make a plan for students who owe NSFAS, whose results are withheld and are being refused to re-register. They also demand that DUT pay outstanding NSFAS fees for 2007 and the full funding for needy students, for 2008. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
