Stephanie Saville COMMENTING on three cases in two days, where women were murdered by boyfriends and an estranged husband, director of Life Line in Pietermaritzburg, Debbie Harrison, told The Witness that they handle on average 20 cases of women seeking advice for partner abuse each month. “It is astonishing to see how many women are bullied. They come in to say they have been threatened or hurt.” Harrison said that the women are often too afraid to seek an interdict against their partner, or to leave them, for fear of reprisals. “They feel trapped by the threats. Most of the men are just big bullies, but unfortunately a small number of them do carry out their threats.” Harrison said Life Line has seen some horrific injuries sustained by women, inflicted on them by their partners — from sjambokkings to broken faces. “Unfortunately, many of these women tend to go back to their partners, who are often apologetic and charming, so it is difficult, frustrating work,” said Harrison. stephs@witness.co.za 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
