Appeal Court Judge Edwin Cameron has finally been appointed to the Constitutional Court, President Kgalema Motlanthe confirmed at the weekend. Cameron’s appointment, in place of Judge Tholie Madala, who has retired, came after the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) called for nominations three times this year for candidates to fill Madala’s post. After the first call, the JSC received too few, and made a second call. The JSC also asked Judge Lex Mpati, the president of the Supreme Court of Appeals, to urge appeal judges to apply, and Cameron made himself available. The JSC was, however, still not happy to make a recommendation to the president on the basis of the nominations it received in the second round, and a third call for nomonations went out. A special sitting of the JSC was held on December 12, and Cameron emerged as the successful candidate. Among the judges who were interviewed, but who were not selected, were Nigel Willis of the Rand High Court and Eberhardt Bertelsmann of the Bloemfontein division. Cameron is regarded as one of the country’s top judges, especially in the field of constitutional affairs, particularly human rights. In April, the JSC will have to select four new judges, including a president, for the Constitutional Court, because the court’s head, Judge President Pius Langa, and judges Kate O’Regan, Albie Sachs and Yvonne Mokgoro are all due to retire later this year.
