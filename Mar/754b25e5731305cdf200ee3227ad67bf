Nash Narrandes Mpophomeni community development leader Frank Mchunu and artist Professor Marc Jambers from Belgium stand with Jambersâ€™s sculpture at the Nokulunga Gumede Reconciliation memorial wall in Mpophomeni yesterday.  Jambers donated the work to be displayed along with sculptures from artists in the community. Jambers, who completed the sculpture in 1985, said he was deeply disturbed, like most people overseas, by the struggle against apartheid and wanted to voice his feelings of distress.  Though he feels proud of his sculpture, he expressed sadness for artists who were killed because of their expression through their poetry and painting. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
