An off-duty policeman shot and killed a suspect who was robbing a Chinese tourist in Market Street in Durban yesterday morning. Police spokesperson Superintendent Vincent Mdunge said the Chinese National was walking along when he was attacked by four armed men who forced him to the ground and took his wallet, money, cellphone and other valuables. Mdunge said that by chance, an off-duty policeman witnessed the event. “He warned the thugs, from a distance, to stop what they were doing. The robbers then fired three shots at the policeman who was able to take cover behind a hard object. As he feared for his life, he returned fire, fatally wounding one of the suspects.” The other suspects fled and have not yet been arrested. Mdunge said that neither the Chinese tourist nor the policeman could be named at present. “We really encourage police members that they must not die at the hands of thugs. If someone poses danger, by law we have a right to shoot to kill.” He said the recent call by MEC for Community Safety and Liaison Bheki Cele, to police “not to die with guns in their pockets”, but to “shoot hard” and shoot to kill when defending themselves against criminals, was relevant. Cele was  reacting to reports of two separate incidents in which police were involved in deadly shootouts with criminals. KZN “super cop” Superintendent Zethembe Chonco, the Kranskop police station commissioner, was killed during an ambush in KwaMaphumulo near Stanger on August 26. In the other incident, Superintendent Frans Bothma was killed while conducting an operation in kwaMashu.
